## üîç Enabling Android App Links
Android App Links are HTTP URLs that bring users directly to specific content in your Android app. In order to enable your app to handle App Links, you need to add intent filter to your Android manifest and host Digital Asset Link JSON file on your domain.

### Adding intent filter to Android manifest
You can use [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing.html#intent) to help you set this up, or do it [manually](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations.html#request-verify). 

It's important to set `android:autoVerify="true"` so that the Android system can check your Digital Asset Link JSON and automatically handle App Links.

#### üíª Example
```xml
<activity ...>

    <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data android:scheme="https" android:host="www.your-domain.name" />
    </intent-filter>

</activity>
```

### Adding Digital Asset Link JSON to your domain
Just like with intent filters, [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing.html#associatesite) can help generate files for you. If you decide to do this manually, official [Google documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations.html#web-assoc) explains how to do it in detail.

Resulting file should be hosted at `https://your-domain.name/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.

#### üíª Example
```json
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "your.package.name",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints":["SHA256 fingerprint of your app‚Äôs signing certificate"]
  }
}]
```

> **NOTE:** To get certificate SHA256 fingerprint you can use `keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore`

## üîç Tracking Android App Links
Exponea SDK can automatically decide whether the Intent that opened your application is an App Link, so you just need to call `Exponea.handleCampaignIntent(intent, applicationContext)`.

App Link parameters are automatically tracked in `session_start` events when new session is started. If your app starts a new session, campaign parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_medium`, `utm_term` and `xnpe_cmp`) are sent within the session parameters to enable you to attribute the new session to a App Link click.

> **NOTE:** If an existing session is resumed by clicking on an App Link, the resumed session is **NOT** attributed to the App Link click, the App Link click parameters are not tracked in the `session_start` event. Session behaviour is determined by the setup of the 'automaticSessionTracking' and 'sessionTimeout' parameters described in [ExponeaConfiguration](./CONFIG.md). Please consider this for manual session handling or when you test the App Link tracking during the development.

In order to track session events with App Link parameters, you should call `Exponea.handleCampaignIntent` **before** your Activity onResume method is called. Ideally, make the call in your MainActivity `.onCreate` method.

#### üíª Example
```kotlin
 class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        Exponea.handleCampaignIntent(intent, applicationContext)
    }
}
```

> **NOTE:** Calling of `Exponea.handleCampaignIntent` is allowed before SDK initialization in case that previous initialization process was done. In such a case, `Exponea.handleCampaignIntent` will track events with configuration of last initialization. Please consider to do SDK initialization in `Application::onCreate` in case of update of your application to apply a fresh new configuration.
